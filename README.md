# GodotEssentials
Project used for a Games Development Society workshop. 

I intended for this workshop to be engaging, interactable and fun. It goes over the very basics of Godot without being too much like a lecture, which is why there is not much emphasis on code. Hopefully people who were there for the workshop feel confident enough to dive in to Godot tutorials and start learning for themselves.

You may notice the slides and game graphics are not very professional, and that's intentional!

I asked people who attended this workshop what they thought and most had good things to say! Complete beginners said they liked the workshop and, after it ended, a couple people went ahead and made some of their own changes, and asked me a couple questions about code. 

People who had used Godot before said that the Godot workshop was too easy for them and they ended up going ahead and doing their own stuff while they waited for beginners to finish the task they were given. Some even helped the beginners who may haave struggled with some steps, so I think this workshop encouraged people to socialise :]

To me, this means that beginners came out of the workshop eager to do and learn more, so it was a success!
